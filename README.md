## Welcome to Elextra

Elextra is a highly advanced and versatile personal assistant. With the help of various algorithms, it finds out what you are asking for, formulates a gist and generates a response.

### How does it work?

*Step 1:* Index algorithm.
This function indexes words by their different meaning, words which relay a similar meaning are put closer together whereas words which relay highly different meanings are put farther away from each other. To do this, the algorithm needs three different lists, each list must contain statements conveying a similar meaning however each list may convey a different meaning.

```markdown
Index examples
>>> list1 = ["the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog","the fast red fox kartwheels over the relaxed dog"]
... list2 = ["the energetic cat takes another fish","the energised feline grabs another fish"]
... list3 = ["the curious mammal peeks at the focused human","the questioning animal looks at the concentrated person"]
>>> ["quick","fast""...","brown","red","...","fox","fox","...","dog","dog","...","lazy","relaxed"]

```
